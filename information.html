        This project aims to explore the interaction between human and AI-generated content. The main focus is on how AI can be used to create scripts for films, specifically focusing on how actors, directors, and viewers perceive the difference between AI-written and human-written material. Through interactive voting, users can guess which characters are AI-generated based on their names and voting patterns.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The voting bar system tracks how many times each name has been clicked, representing the growing popularity of each choice. The project also highlights the potential impact of AI on artistic industries, particularly film, and explores whether AI could become a tool for enhancing creativity or a threat to employment in the arts.
